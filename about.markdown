Hello, My name is Niklas Lundberg and I am a computer science student at Lule√• University of Technology.
My alias on GitHub and many other sites is [Blinningjr](https://github.com/Blinningjr)(this link will bring you to may GitHub page).
In this blog I will post information on what projects I am currently working and also information on topics I think need more information sources or better explanations.
If you find that my posts contain information that is wrong or some other issue I welcome you to crate an issue on this repository were you explain the issue so that I can update and fix it.
